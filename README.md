## üöÄ Features  
- Two-player mode (X vs O)  
- Winner detection using predefined win patterns  
- Reset and New Game functionality  
- Disables boxes once selected to prevent overwriting  
- Displays a congratulatory message for the winner

## ‚ö° Core Logic  

### 1. **Game State Management**
```js
if(turnO) {
    box.innerText = "O";
    turnO = false;
} else {
    box.innerText = "X";
    turnO = true;
}
box.disabled = true;



# win patterns
const winPatterns = [
  [0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8],   // Rows
  [0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8],   // Columns
  [0,4,8], [2,4,6]             // Diagonals
];

# winner detection

const checkwinner = () => {
  for (let pattern of winPatterns) {
    let [a, b, c] = pattern;
    if (
      boxes[a].innerText !== "" &&
      boxes[a].innerText === boxes[b].innerText &&
      boxes[b].innerText === boxes[c].innerText
    ) {
      showWinner(boxes[a].innerText);
    }
  }
};

# reset and new game
const resetGame = () => {
  turnO = true;
  enableBoxes();
  msgContainer.classList.add("hide");
};





## ‚ùì FAQ / Interview Questions  

### 1. How is the winner detected?  
The game checks predefined **winning patterns** (rows, columns, diagonals) after each move.  
If three boxes in a pattern contain the same non-empty value (`"X"` or `"O"`), that player is declared the winner.  

```js
if (
  boxes[a].innerText !== "" &&
  boxes[a].innerText === boxes[b].innerText &&
  boxes[b].innerText === boxes[c].innerText
) {
  showWinner(boxes[a].innerText);
}

2. Why do we disable boxes after a click?

To prevent a player from overwriting a move.
Once clicked, a box is disabled (box.disabled = true), ensuring fairness and proper turn-taking.

3. What data structure is used to store win conditions?

A 2D array (winPatterns) is used, where each sub-array represents a possible winning line.

const winPatterns = [
  [0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8],   // Rows
  [0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8],   // Columns
  [0,4,8], [2,4,6]             // Diagonals
];

4. How is the game state (turn tracking) managed?

A boolean variable turnO keeps track of whose turn it is.

true ‚Üí O‚Äôs turn

false ‚Üí X‚Äôs turn
It toggles after every valid move.

if(turnO) {
  box.innerText = "O";
  turnO = false;
} else {
  box.innerText = "X";
  turnO = true;
}




5. Difference between Reset Game and New Game buttons?

Reset Game: Clears the board but continues in the same session.

New Game: Clears the board and hides the winner message (starts a fresh session).

Both use the same resetGame() logic, but the New Game button only appears after a winner is declared.

6. How can you extend this project (like adding AI to play against computer)?

Possible improvements:

AI Opponent (minimax algorithm or random moves).

Draw Detection (when all boxes are filled with no winner).

Scoreboard (track wins for X and O).

Responsive UI for mobile devices.
